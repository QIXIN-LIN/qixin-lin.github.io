Greetings! I'm Qixin (Chi-Shin), a master's student in [Computational Social Science program](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) with a focus on Sociology at the University of Chicago. My research interests lie at the intersections of labor, working skills, and employment issues.

I use a computational toolkit that includes text analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and various modeling techniques to analyze complex datasets. My goal is to understand the factors affecting labor markets and knowledge networks, aiming to provide insights that can increase access to quality jobs and improve workers' rights and well-being. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans) of [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/).

Inspired by [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), I've grown my interest in interdisciplinary research and complex systems. I'm actively expanding my knowledge in fields such as ecology and physics, always seeking connections between different domains of knowledge.

You can find my CV here: [Qixin's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Latest_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)

Beyond academia, I enjoy exploring Chicago's neighborhoods, listening to music, hiking, and couchsurfing globally. I'm always open to new knowledge, experienve and food!

Thank you for taking an interest in my intellectual voyage! Feel free to reach me at qxlin@uchicago.edu :)
